## Competition Acceptance

**Entries must be received 30 days prior to the competition date**. No phone entries will be accepted. All entries will be accepted on a first come, first served basis. All entries are limited to the amount of performance time available. Registration may be completed online or forms may be printed, completed and mailed. **Entries are not considered received in the office without full payment and a completed waiver and release form**. Names and birth date of all contestants must appear on the official entry form or the entry cannot be accepted.

## Age Groups

Age group is determined by the performer’s age as of January 1st of the competition year.

- Petite --- Ages 8 & under
- Junior --- Ages 9 - 11
- Teen --- Ages 12 - 15
- Senior --- Ages 16 - 19

The average age determines the age group for Duet/Trio, Small Groups, Large Groups, and Line. Add the ages (Jan. 1st of Competition Year) of all the contestants, and then divide by the number of contestants. If an average age ends in 0.5 or above, round down.

Duet/Trios, Groups, and Lines that include dancers of different age division will compete no more than one age division younger than the oldest dancer, regardless of average age. (Example: If a group includes a dancer Age 16 (Senior) and the average age is 11 (Junior), the group will compete one level above Junior (Teen).)

## Competition Levels

- **Twinkling Stars**: Must receive 2 hrs. or less of dance instruction per week and have 2 years or less dance experience.
- **Shimmering Stars**: Must receive 3 - 6 hrs. of dance instruction per week.
- **Dazzling Stars**: Must receive over 6 hrs. of dance instruction per week.

Competition Levels are based on total class time. If you have mixed level dancers in a routine and 50% of them are higher level dancers, the routine should be entered at the higher level. Levels may not be changed after the registration deadline (30 days prior to the competition). If a routine is registered incorrectly, it can be adjudicated but will not be allowed to compete for awards. If a level is increased for one student, all their routines must be checked for accuracy.

## Entry Divisions

Solo (1 performer)
Duet/Trio (2 - 3 performers)
Small Group (4 - 9 performers)
Large Group (10 - 19 performers)

This mixture of age, breadth of dance experience and extensive background in performing arts contributes to the diverse range of feedback judges can offer all our competitors.
