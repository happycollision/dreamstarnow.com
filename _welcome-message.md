At Dreamstar, we strive to bring America's dance talent together with experienced judges from all over the country in order for young dancers to receive the feedback they need to take their skills to the next level. Dreamstar offers the dance student the opportunity to perform for qualified judges in a constructive and friendly environment. We provide opportunities for talented dancers to attend master classes.

We are an organization dedicated to helping young people improve self esteem, poise, and confidence through the art of dance. Our friendly, helpful staff will make this a rewarding experience for everyone attending.

Our competition tour will be featured in 4 cities throughout the Midwestern United states and will foster dedication, discipline, and appreciation of teamwork through the dance.

We look forward to seeing you this season! Dreamstar will help fulfill the dream of the dancer to shine on stage!
